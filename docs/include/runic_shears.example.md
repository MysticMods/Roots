### Examples

```zenscript
import mods.roots.RunicShears;

// Creates a recipe that obtains nether wart from red nether bricks
// and then converts the bricks into normal nether bricks
RunicShears.addRecipe("nether_wart_block", <minecraft:nether_wart>*2, <minecraft:nether_brick>, <minecraft:red_nether_brick>, <minecraft:red_nether_brick>);

// Creates a recipe that obtains eggs from chickens with a 2 minute cooldown
RunicShears.addEntityRecipe("egg_from_chicken", <minecraft:egg>*2, <entity:minecraft:chicken>, 120*20);

// Removes all recipes (both entity & block) that give fey leather
RunicShears.removeRecipe(<roots:fey_leather>);
```

### Notes

Note that the `removeRecipe` function will attempt to remove any recipe (both runic shearing of blocks and of entities) that matches the desired output.
