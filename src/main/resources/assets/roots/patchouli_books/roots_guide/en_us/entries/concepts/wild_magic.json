Great power can be unlocked through even the simplest catalyst.  This is the foundation of Wild Magic.$(br2)Over time, a group of like-minded individuals, well-versed in harnessing wild magic gathered together and formed a concord."

      "text": "As the Druids became more obsessed with the power of the Fey, they began to forget their own roots, some giving up on wild magic almost entirely.$(br2)Although the exact details are unclear, it was likely this obsession that signalled the end of the treaty with the Fey.$(br2)All portals were closed, all trade ceased, and the Order of Druids was left a skeleton, scrambling to re-learn what once they had mastered."
