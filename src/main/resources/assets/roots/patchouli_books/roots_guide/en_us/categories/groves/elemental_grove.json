  "description": "The elementals, primal and wild, are largely difficult to contain or even communicate with for most. Druids who choose to dedicate themselves to the teachings of the Elementals may earn enough respect to learn secret teachings others can only dream of - but these teachings, while powerful, are often destructive and difficult to control without using more expensive and powerful reagents to contain their effects.",
