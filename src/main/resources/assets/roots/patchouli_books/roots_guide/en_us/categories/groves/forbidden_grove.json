  "description": "Of all of the Groves, there is one which druids are warned never to approach - the powers that lurk within contradict everything that traditional druidism stands for, not coexisting with the natural world, but instead using the power of the moon and darkness to warp and manipulate it. Despite this, circles of druids exist which pledge themselves to these otherworldy powers, and those who do so exclusively have been known to accrue incredible abilities.",
