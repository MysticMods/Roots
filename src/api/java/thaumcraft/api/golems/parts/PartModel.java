/**
 * 
 * This class is used to define a model used by a part. The model needs to be in the .obj format and you may have to provide a texture. 
 * You can specify which model parts use your texture and which should use the material texture.
 * 
 * You can also specify an attachment point for the entire model. 
 * 	HANDS will render the model twice - one at the end of each arm.
 * 	LEGS will render the model twice (once for each leg) and will apply the normal walking animation tranforms to them
 * 	BODY and HEAD should be fairly obvious
